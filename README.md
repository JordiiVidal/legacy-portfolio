## Introduction

I am Jordi Vidal Roselló, a passionate Full Stack Developer with over 5 years of experience. This portfolio is designed to highlight my skills in JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Sass (SCSS)
- Bootstrap
- Vite (for development and bundling)

## Project Structure

The project structure is relatively simple:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `src/`: Contains JavaScript, Sass, and other source files.
- `public/`: Contains all static assets.
- `package.json`: Node.js package configuration file, generated by Vite.
- `vite.config.js`: Vite configuration file.

## How to Run Locally

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JordiiVidal/my-portfolio`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd my-portfolio`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5173/my-portfolio](http://localhost:5173/my-portfolio)

The development server will automatically open the project in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the source files will trigger live updates.

## Deployment

The portfolio is deployed on GitHub Pages using Vite.
